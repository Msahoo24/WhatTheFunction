# WhatTheFunction
_______
This is a repository of MATLAB functions that I have accumulated or written over my 2-year fellowship at Marcus Autism Center. 
Some functions are specific to data worked with at Marcus, but others arent. They are organized into folders. Hopefully, other fellows or RAs working at Marcus will find these useful. 

# Folders
_______
### General
- General functions that don't necessarily perform any sort of statistical task. 

### Marcus Autism Center Specific
- These functions are specific for work done at Marcus Autism Center. These include functions to group and mean certain queries of data, formatting DEX ID inputs, etc. If you work at Marcus or have worked   at Marcus and would like to contribute, send a PR, just please use the comment template included in the repository.

### Signal Processing
- These functions are valuable for any work using densely sampled continous functions. I only breifly worked in signal processing, so this folder is a little sparse. 

### Statistics
- General statistics functions. I plan to add more to this.
